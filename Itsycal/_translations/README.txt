The Itsycal directory contains .xliff files exported from
Xcode and then filled in with appropriate translations.
The files were then imported back to Xcode.

To export, navigate to the project and then choose
Editor > Export For Localization...

Edit the file and then to import choose
Editor > Import Localizations...

I used the Counterparts Lite.app to edit the xliff's.
